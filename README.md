# XDSChain

## Introduction

Welcome to the **XDSChain** repository! This project is dedicated to the implementation of the XDSChain concept, aimed at enhancing cross-enterprise document sharing.

## Short Brief

- The `nodeJS_XDSActor` folder contains all Node.js code used to implement IHE XDS Actors within this project. Each actor has been developed following the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework, specifically the Cross-enterprise Document Sharing Set-B (XDS.b) Profile.

- The `registrySmartcontract` folder contains all Solidity-based smart contracts implemented for the Document Registry Actor and Log Viewer.

- The `xdsTransactionSample` folder contains a sample of XDS transactions provided by the IHE community, which we accessed a few years ago to guide the implementation of XDS Actors.

## Ongoing Improvements

We are continuously working on further adjustments to improve the repository and make it more accessible and easier to understand for visitors.
